[![Copr build status](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/nelsonaloysio/nautilus-typeahead/package/nautilus-typeahead/status_image/last_build.png)](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/nelsonaloysio/nautilus-typeahead/package/nautilus-typeahead/)

Automatically builds a **GNOME Files** (**[Nautilus](https://apps.gnome.org/en/Nautilus/)**) RPM with type-ahead functionality for [Fedora Linux](https://fedoraproject.org/).

:sparkles: A [Copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/nelsonaloysio/nautilus-typeahead/) is available to automate installing and updating the package.

:package: The resulting RPMs are also listed for download in the [Releases](https://github.com/nelsonaloysio/fedora-nautilus-typeahead-rpm/releases) page.

> - Supported Fedora versions: **39, 40** (Workstation/Silverblue).
> - Supported Nautilus versions: **45.2.1, 46.2**.

## Description

The default behavior on Nautilus nowadays is to type to search, i.e., to start a search when typing a character.
This package simply applies a pre-existing patch developed by the community to restore the type-ahead functionality,
i.e., browsing/navigating on key press, the default behavior on many file managers.

The new functionality may be toggled on the Preferences window (*Search on type ahead*):

## Install package

To install this package via Copr, first [enable the repository](https://docs.pagure.org/copr.copr/how_to_enable_repo.html) on your system with:

```bash
dnf copr enable nelsonaloysio/nautilus-typeahead
```

> Alternatively, [download](https://github.com/nelsonaloysio/fedora-nautilus-typeahead/releases) or [build the package from source](#build-from-source) before following the next steps.

### On Fedora Workstation

To install the package on [Fedora Workstation](https://fedoraproject.org/en/workstation), use the following command:

```bash
dnf swap nautilus nautilus-typeahead
```

This will replace one package with the other and avoid file conflicts.

> Note: if installing from a local package, replace `nautilus-typeahead` with `./nautilus-typeahead-*.rpm`.

### On Fedora Silverblue

To layer the package on [Fedora Silverblue](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/silverblue/), use the following command:

```bash
rpm-ostree override remove nautilus --install nautilus-typeahead
```

The installed version will be replaced and type-ahead functionality will be enabled. **Restart** your machine in order to boot into the updated deployment.

> Note: if installing from a local package, replace `nautilus-typeahead` with `./nautilus-typeahead-*.rpm`.

___

## Build from source

Simply run the script to install prerequisites with `dnf`, patch Nautilus, and build the RPM with:

```bash
bash build-nautilus-typeahead-rpm.sh
```

A new file `nautilus-typeahead-*.rpm` will be created by the end of the process.

> **Note:** on Silverblue, it is required to run the command above inside a `toolbox` to obtain the
> required dependencies using `dnf`, avoiding the need to layer them on your base system.

### Clean up dependencies

After building the RPM file, any installed dependencies may be removed with:

```bash
dnf history undo $(dnf history list --reverse | tail -n1 | cut -f1 -d\|)
```

The command above will simply undo the changes made by the last `dnf` execution.
