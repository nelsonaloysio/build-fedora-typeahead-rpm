# fedora-nautilus-typeahead-rpm

Automatically builds a **GNOME Files** (**[Nautilus](https://apps.gnome.org/en/Nautilus/)**) RPM with type-ahead functionality for [Fedora Linux](https://fedoraproject.org/).

:sparkles: The resulting RPM is available for download under [Releases](https://github.com/nelsonaloysio/fedora-nautilus-typeahead-rpm/releases) for Fedora **39/40/41** (Workstation/Silverblue).

## Description

The default behavior on Nautilus nowadays is to type to search, i.e., to start a search when typing a character.
This package simply applies a pre-existing patch developed by the community to restore the type-ahead functionality,
i.e., browsing/navigating on key press, the default behavior on many file managers.

The new functionality may be toggled on the Preferences window (*Search on type ahead*):

## Install

### On Fedora Workstation

To install the package on Fedora Workstation, use the following command:

```bash
dnf swap nautilus ./nautilus-typeahead-*.rpm
```

This will replace one package with the other and avoid file conflicts.

### On Fedora Silverblue

To layer the package on Silverblue, use the following command:

```bash
rpm-ostree install --force-replacefiles ./nautilus-typeahead-*.rpm
```

The installed version will be replaced and type-ahead functionality will be enabled. **Restart** your machine in order to boot into the updated deployment.

## Building the RPM file

Simply run the script to install prerequisites with `dnf` and build Nautilus:

```bash
bash build-nautilus-typeahead-rpm.sh
```

**Note:** on Silverblue, run the command above inside a `toolbox` to avoid the need to layer the required dependencies on your base system.

A new file `nautilus-typeahead-*.rpm` will be created by the end of the process.

### Clean up dependencies

After building the RPM file, you may remove any installed dependencies with:

```bash
dnf history undo $(dnf history list --reverse | tail -n1 | cut -f1 -d\|)
```

The command above will undo the changes made on the last `dnf` execution.
